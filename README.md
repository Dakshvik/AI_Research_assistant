ü§ñ AI Research Assistant

A modern web application that acts as an AI agent for generating structured, evidence-based reports on any research topic. This tool leverages a powerful generative AI model with live web access to deliver accurate and up-to-date information.

‚ú® Features

Clean & Modern UI: A responsive and intuitive interface built with Tailwind CSS.

Dynamic Report Generation: Ask any research question and receive a fully-formatted report with headings, lists, and links.

Grounded in Facts: The AI uses live web search to ground its answers in real, up-to-date sources, ensuring reports are accurate and evidence-based.

Persistent History: All generated reports are saved to your browser's local storage, allowing you to revisit them later.

Usage Dashboard: Keep track of how many questions you've asked and reports you've generated.

Polished UX: Includes features like a skeleton loader during generation, smooth animations, and a drag-and-drop interface for future file integration.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Backend: Netlify Serverless Functions

AI Model: A generative AI model (e.g., Google's Gemini) with Google Search grounding, accessed via the serverless backend.

üöÄ How It Works

This project uses a secure client-server architecture to protect API keys and deliver a powerful AI experience.

Client-Side (Browser): The user enters a research question on the static HTML page.

API Call: The frontend JavaScript makes a fetch request to a backend Netlify Serverless Function, sending the user's question.

Server-Side (Netlify): The serverless function receives the request. It securely calls a powerful AI API (like the Google Gemini API), instructing it to act as a research assistant and use Google Search to find relevant, up-to-date information.

Report Generation: The AI model browses the web, synthesizes the information, and generates a structured report in HTML format.

Response: The serverless function sends the generated HTML report back to the frontend.

Display & Store: The JavaScript dynamically displays the report on the page and saves it to the user's localStorage for future access.

‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need to set up both the frontend and the Netlify serverless function.

1. Frontend

The frontend consists of index.html, styles.css, and script.js. You can serve these files using any static file server, or by deploying the repository directly to Netlify.

2. Backend (Netlify Function)

You need to create a Netlify account and link your repository.

Create a file at this path: netlify/functions/generate-report.js.

Inside this file, you will write the Node.js code that calls the AI API (e.g., Google's generativelanguage SDK).

Store your secret API key in Netlify's environment variables, not in your code.

Example generate-report.js structure:

// netlify/functions/generate-report.js
const { GoogleGenerativeAI } = require("@google/generative-ai");

exports.handler = async function(event, context) {
    const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY);
    const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-pro" });
    
    // ... logic to get the user's question from the event body ...
    // ... construct the prompt ...
    // ... call model.generateContent() with Google Search grounding enabled ...

    return {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify({ /* the AI's response */ }),
    };
};



üó∫Ô∏è Future Roadmap: Evolving into a Campus Assistant

The vision for this project is to expand it into a comprehensive AI Campus Assistant, designed to help students with their academic workflow. Planned features include:

[ ] Full Document Analysis:

[ ] Enable File Uploads: Fully implement the file upload feature to handle .pdf and .pptx files.

[ ] AI-Powered Summarization: Develop the agent's ability to provide concise summaries of uploaded lecture notes (PDFs) and presentations (PPTs).

[ ] Q&A on Documents: Allow students to ask questions and get answers based on the content of their uploaded files.

[ ] Enhanced Research Capabilities:

[ ] Source Citations: Automatically generate citations for the web sources used in a report in standard academic formats (e.g., APA, MLA).

[ ] Deeper Analysis: Integrate features to identify key themes, potential biases, and conflicting information within the research sources.

[ ] Improved User Experience:

[ ] Streaming Responses: Implement response streaming to show the report as it's being generated, improving the tool's responsiveness.
